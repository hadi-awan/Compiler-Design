This program always calculates fact(n) correctly when n is even.
When n is odd, fact(n) is correct if dynamic scoping is implemented,
but with static scoping fact(n-1) is returned instead.
fact(9) should be 362880 and your program calculated 40320.
Therefore static scoping was properly implemented.
